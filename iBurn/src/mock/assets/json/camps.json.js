Through the music and art, the participants will express themselves using their unique gifts.  The Monkey Hut community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We think for people to go from listening to music to making music can transform and individual.  Everyone is invited to play music and craft with us.  Through making music and crafting together we seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves.  There is no substitute for immediate experience."

All art in the Home is up for adoption, all the prospective new parent needs to do is fill out a small adoption form and clip it to the Home in place of their newfound art darling. \r\n\r\nArt may also be committed to the Home, just put it securely in place and say good-bye. If you have multiples of similar pieces, please bring them around to the shade structure.  While the emphasis is on visual art such as paintings, drawings and photos, other mediums such as small sculptural art are welcome.  The Gifting Box is for even smaller items such as jewelry, swag and trinkets."

We've become skilled at recognizing when people are ready to change direction, and helping them dig out and uncover ideas about what those new directions might look like.\r\n\r\nMagic and ritual use a combination of physical, emotional, and mental transformations that work. They've been developed and tested for tens of thousands of years, across every culture known to man, and keep converging on the same basic methods *because* they work. While modern culture provides many benefits - ready access to food, to health care, to shelter, to conveniences and entertainment and distraction - those same benefits can separate us from the flow of life that we originally evolved within. Magic and ritual seem so powerful to modern humans precisely because, for the most part, they have never experienced them directly.\r\n\r\nLet's fix that."

Neighbors love Fuego's Karaoke Stage because \"No Mercy\" means any listener can end any unpleasant sound at any time--a missed note, fade to dance music! \"Mo' Mercy\" means well-keyed voices chime in, mic volumes magically adjust and the performance sounds great! \r\nFuego's Stage also invites guests to an Open Mic and hosts DJ dance parties, spoken word and musical performances.\r\nCamp Fuego's namesake is its Art Installation, \"Fuego\", an arresting life-sized stretched barbed-wire prancing HORSE with flame effects coming from her eyes and mane. \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/campfuegoburningman/"

We integrate ancient esoteric teachings of tantra with modern self-development techniques to create a unique environment for experiences that prepare the ground for evolution. To envision and prepare the world of tomorrow we need to rewire our nervous systems and free ourselves from the old paradigm. Tantra is an accelerator of evolution. The context of Burning Man serves as an amplifier to these ancient Tantric techniques. The collective ambition towards freedom present during Burning Man is unique. It erases differences between individuals and supports the Tantric effort of transcending all false dualities. From regular morning energetic practices to one-of-a-kind ceremonies and ritual, Tantra Mantra embraces and promotes the change towards a new human agreement. We leave a great place for spontaneity... Expect the unexpected."

When we pursue the light we use movement, the senses, sensuality, sexuality and connection.  This beckons us in and brings the light of awareness back into the bodies we have vacated. We are particularly interested in the seat of power and intention housed in our bodies. To go there fully requires confronting our shadows. We embrace those as well as we dive into shame, fear, anger, unsavory memories from this life and past lives, and disempowering images of our bodies. Welcome home."

Rather than being a performance in which the audience listens to musicians, it is a participatory spiritual practice in which everyone is encouraged to sing and express their inner joy.\n\nThe Sacred Song Teahouse is a Burning Man camp dedicated to creating and maintaining a serene temple oasis for joining our voices and diving into the Divine... together. We welcome the keepers of tea wisdom to join us in our temple space to sooth our throats with their mystical infusions. We welcome musicians to join us on stage and have a safe and secure place for them to store their instruments during the Burn. Together we create Magic!"

We enjoy helping people work on art projects and helping camps who have suffered structural difficulties, but we also help with minor automotive problems, generator issues, and fix an inordinate amount of bikes. Whatever people bring us, we'll try and fix if we can. We do not have lots of raw building materials, like 2x4s, PVP pipes, or plywood, but do have a need/want bulletin board to connect gifts with needs. The Playa often provides!"

Over the next 5 years, we will be investigating each of these strange lands, then reconvening back here to tell of our adventures.\n\nWhile our travels instilled in us a breadth of knowledge, the catharsis of adventure has left us with a desire to share our experiences with the world.

In addition to daily and nightly events, we will also be serving food and drink which we have discovered along the way.  And what of your travels?  Do you have stories to share with us?

Weary travelers come sit for a spell, kick up your hooves and dance, or begin a new journey as you slide through a pulsing pink sphincter into the luscious cocoon of his polyphonic peritoneum. The village itself also offers a \"petting zoo\", public lounge spaces, art installations, and more."

Contra is fast-paced yet easy to learn with a caller who instructs, but with room for dancers to improvise and embellish.  There is no need to arrive with a partner - most dancers swap after each dance.  Lines of couples flow through each other creating a bonding, playful, noncompetitive, all-ages community dance.  There is no required footwork and contra is possible for many with disabilities.  If you are smiling, you are doing it right.  Everyone who shows up will have fun."

A major focal point at our parties are the resident dancers who show off their pole skills, as well as teaching newcomers basic pole skills allowing for participatory fun for all! We host several parties throughout the week, with entire camp participating in the production of these events offering a welcome environment for all burners to drop in, grab a drink and mingle on their way out to playa.\n\nThe Reflection Tree, a two-meter tower of 2,160 LEDs with a sensor array that picks up and redisplays the most saturated color in every direction. The LEDs change over time as they flow up, allowing the viewer to \"go back in time\" by viewing the colors of previous playa passers-by."

It's a time for mindful intension, a time for deepest hopes, a time for silly little pleasures and fun! And in this camp, it's always time to wish! 11:11 24/7, baby! \r\n\r\nThis is a time for you! And if you need help learning the beautiful art of wishmaking, come and we will teach you! Tune in, believe, express and observe: you wish might just come true. \r\n\r\nWe tried our best to guess and pre-fulfill some of the more common wishes out there: delicious coffee and artisanal tea blends, yoga, a place for rest, loving company, esthetic pleasure, hugs and good vibes.\r\n\r\nIt's 11:11 somewhere! Make a wish!"

We project a liquid light show on the ceiling and serve drinks from our tiki bar (a full bar, including an ice cold beer upon request, plus we always have water out).  We've got a great sound system and an endless supply of live Dead recordings.  At night we offer live music from our House Band on the Brokedown Palace stage, plus we are always open to host impromptu performances.

An assortment of electrolarynx machines are available for use in our comfy, shady lounge. Bring your friends and have a monotone robot voice singalong. We also offer smart device technology called The Whisper App. Whisper a soliloquy into our devices with the app, and it's repeated  out loud for all to hear. We offer refreshing iced tea, chai and kombucha, (bring your own cup!), snacks, cough drops, throat sprays, plenty o' popsicles, chill music and good vibes. Losing your voice is fun."

Proceeding further into the 747 fuselage, they will be asked to fill out an Emotional Baggage Tag, to let go of anything holding them back. \u00a0Once completed, they hang the tag on the wall of baggage handles. Next, a flight attendant asks them for their destination (where they are going on their journey through life), which will be shared on a Boarding Pass. \u00a0This pass is hung onto the Destination wall. Once completed, the traveler is given a pair of airplane wings. \r\nCome and be inspired, and dream of what is possible, while letting go of the things that hold you back in life,"
