iBurn-Android
=============

iBurn for Android

## TODO

+ On-Boarder
+ Throttle POI search. Doing so on every Map camera event change is overkill.
+ Better organize the Event ListView. I wrote a sectionizer by date last year that I'll plop in at minimum.
+ Provide map UI to set home camp
+ Restrict pannable map boundaries
+ When searching map, smooth zoom to frame results
