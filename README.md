## Installation

* Make sure your Android SDK packages are up to date.
* `$ git clone https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Android --recursive`
* `$ cd ./iBurn-Android`
* `$ touch ./iBurn/src/main/java/com/gaiagps/iburn/SECRETS.kt && open ./iBurn/src/main/java/com/gaiagps/iburn/SECRETS.kt`
* Copy the following into `SECRETS.kt`:

    ```java
    package com.gaiagps.iburn

    const val UNLOCK_CODE = "WHATEVER_PASSWORD"
    const val IBURN_API_URL = "https://SOME_API"
    const val MAPBOX_API_KEY = "YOUR_MAPBOX_KEY"
    ```
* Copy the following into `./iBurn/fabric.properties`:

    apiKey=yourFabricApiKey

* `$ ./gradlew assembleDebug` or from Android Studio invoke 'Import Project' and select the `./iBurn-Android` directory.

**Note**: Camp, Art and Event location data (`camps.json`, `art.json`, `events.json`) are embargoed by the Burning Man Organization until the gates open each year. Sorry!

Fortunately, you can still run and test the app with the previous year's data.

## Annual Update

#### Update code and text resources

* Update `app_name` and `current_year` in iBurn/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
* Update `MOCK_NOW_DATE` in CurrentDateProvider (Used when simulating event time during testing)
* Update `versionYear`, `versionName` and `versionCode` in `iBurn/build.gradle`
* Update `EVENT_START_DATE` and `EVENT_END_DATE` in AdapterUtils.java
* Update `EMBARGO_DATE` in Embargo.java
* Update `UNLOCK_CODE` in SECRETS.kt

#### Art Images/Audio Tour

The art images and audio can be pulled from the iburn-Data library and should be put in `./assets/art_images` and `./assets/audio_tour` respectively.

#### Update playa data

1. Check out iBurn-Data into a directory adjacent to this repository's root, and point iBurn-Data to the branch appropriate for the current year. Note this will usually be the private repo.
2. `./gradlew updateData`. This will copy updated map, geocoder, art images, and api (camp, art, event) json files to this repo.
3. If the map.mbtiles were updated, bump `MapboxMapFragment.MBTILES_VERSION`
4 Update `DATABASE_NAME` in `PlayaDatabase2.kt` to represent the current year. Commit this change.
5. Make these temporary changes to app to generate a database file from JSON. Do not commit:
      *  Set `USE_BUNDLED_DB` to `false` in `PlayaDatabase2.kt`
      *  Uncomment the call to `bootstrapDatabaseFromJson` in `MainActivity`'s `onCreate`
6. Launch the app and confirm database bootstrap completion with logline `MainActivity: Bootstrap success: true`.
7. Copy the generated database from your device. Depending on the value of the database name
set in PlayaDatabase2.kt the file will be located somewhere like `/data/data/com.iburnapp.iburn3.debug/databases/playaDatabase2023.db`.
You can use Android Studio's "Device File Explorer" to conveniently copy this, or use `adb pull` from
the command line. Place the saved database in `iBurn/src/main/assets/databases`
8. return the value of `USE_BUNDLED_DB` in PlayaDatabase2.kt to `true`, Comment out call to `bootstrapDatabaseFromJson` in `MainActivity`'s `onCreate`

## TODO

* Pretty up that item detail view.
* Handle bundled database migrations so we allow app updates to use newer bundled data without using user modifications like favorites
* Investigate Mapbox offline issues. Seems like it's possible Mapbox gets into a state where it stops displaying the map

## Releasing
Make sure you've:

+ Set embargo date correctly in `Embargo.java`, and set `EVENT_START_DATE` and `EVENT_STOP_DATE` in `AdapterUtils`
+ Incremented the version code and name in ./iBurn/build.grade
The final pre-signed store release should be built with:

```
    $ ./gradlew assembleRegularUnsigned
```

Pass the resulting apk off for signing. Then zipalign before publishing:

    $ zipalign -f -v 4 ./signed.apk ./signed-aligned.apk
