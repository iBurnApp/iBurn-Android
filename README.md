## Installation

* Make sure your Android SDK packages are up to date.
* `$ git clone https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Android --recursive`
* `$ cd ./iBurn-Android`
* `$ touch ./iBurn/src/main/java/com/gaiagps/iburn/SECRETS.kt && open ./iBurn/src/main/java/com/gaiagps/iburn/SECRETS.kt`
* Copy the following into `SECRETS.kt`:

    ```java
    package com.gaiagps.iburn

    const val UNLOCK_CODE = "WHATEVER_PASSWORD"
    const val IBURN_API_URL = "https://SOME_API"
    const val MAPBOX_API_KEY = "YOUR_MAPBOX_KEY"
    ```
* Copy the following into `./iBurn/fabric.properties`:

    apiKey=yourFabricApiKey

* `$ ./gradlew assembleDebug` or from Android Studio invoke 'Import Project' and select the `./iBurn-Android` directory.

**Note**: Camp, Art and Event location data (`camps.json`, `art.json`, `events.json`) are embargoed by the Burning Man Organization until the gates open each year. Sorry!

Fortunately, you can still run and test the app with the previous year's data.

## Annual Update

#### Update code and text resources

* Update event year as `versionYear` `iBurn/build.gradle`
* Update `versionCode` and `versionName` in `iBurn/build.gradle`
    * Increment `versionCode` by 1, and set `versionName` to "$versionYear.1" for first release.
* Update event dates in `EventInfo.kt` (Event start, end, and embargo dates)
* Update `UNLOCK_CODE` in SECRETS.kt


#### Update playa data

1. Run `./gradlew updateData`. This will update the iBurn-Data submodule, copy updated map, geocoder, art images, art audio tour, and api json (camp, art, event) files to this repo.
3. If the map.mbtiles were updated, bump `MapboxMapFragment.MBTILES_VERSION`
4. Update the `databaseName` property in `iBurn/build.gradle` by bumping the version number. This will trigger a copy of the playa api database tables on next app run.
5. Connect an Android device with developer mode enabled and run `./gradlew :iBurn:bootstrapDatabase` to install the debug build, trigger
   database generation, and copy the resulting file to
   `iBurn/src/main/assets/databases/$databaseName`.

#### Art Images/Audio Tour

The `./gradlew updateData` will copy art images and tour audio from the iBurn-Data repo to `./assets/art_images` and `./assets/audio_tour` respectively.

## TODO

* Pretty up that item detail view.
* Investigate Mapbox offline and SIGABRT issues. Seems like it's possible Mapbox gets into a state where it stops displaying the map

## Releasing
Make sure you've:
* Set event dates correctly in `EventInfo.kt`
* Incremented the version code and name in ./iBurn/build.grade
The final pre-signed store release should be built with:

```
    $ ./gradlew assembleRegularUnsigned
```

Pass the resulting apk off for signing. Then zipalign before publishing:

    $ zipalign -f -v 4 ./signed.apk ./signed-aligned.apk
